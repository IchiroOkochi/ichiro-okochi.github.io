## Overview
Created a planning tool for engineering teams to map milestones, blockers, and delivery confidence.

## Role
Drove product discovery, visual system design, and implementation of key frontend interactions.

## Problem
Teams used disconnected docs and chats; plans drifted and status reports became stale.

## Constraints
- Needed sub-100ms feel for board interactions.
- Required support for low-bandwidth coworking spaces.
- Accessibility target: full keyboard operation.

## Approach
Designed a card-based system with optimistic updates and local-first caching for edits.

## Architecture
App Router frontend with cached route segments, API-backed sync worker, and immutable board snapshots.

## Results
- 2.4x increase in weekly plan updates.
- 71% reduction in meeting time spent on status gathering.
- NPS improved from 24 to 52 after launch.

## Impact
The app became the default weekly planning workflow for three squads in under one month.

## Engineering Decisions
- Introduced command palette + keyboard shortcuts before adding advanced analytics.
- Selected lightweight motion patterns instead of dense charting libraries to keep performance high.

## Lessons Learned
Speed of interaction strongly influenced adoption more than feature breadth.

## Next Steps
Launch dependency heatmap and AI-assisted retrospective prompts.
