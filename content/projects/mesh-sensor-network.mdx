## Overview
Designed and shipped a low-power sensor mesh that captures vibration and thermal anomalies from rotating machinery.

## Role
Owned firmware architecture, gateway reliability, and dashboard UX for operations technicians.

## Problem
Existing inspections were manual and reactive, causing avoidable downtime.

## Constraints
- Interference-heavy metal environment.
- Battery life target of 12+ months.
- Technician UI had to be operable on gloves + tablets.

## Approach
Implemented adaptive sampling on nodes and prioritized alert packets over periodic telemetry.

## Architecture
Nodes stream MQTT packets to a local gateway, then sync to a cloud timeseries store with a retry queue.

## Results
- 37% reduction in unplanned stoppages during pilot.
- 96.4% packet delivery reliability across 3 floors.
- Battery estimates reached 14.2 months median.

## Impact
- Maintenance planners shifted from weekly checks to risk-based scheduling.
- Alert-to-response time dropped from 45 min to 9 min.

## Engineering Decisions
- Chose gossip-style routing over strict tree topology to increase fault tolerance.
- Built OTA rollback in bootloader for safer field updates.

## Lessons Learned
Hardware UX matters as much as backend reliability when systems are used under pressure.

## Next Steps
Add anomaly clustering to reduce duplicate alerts and improve root cause hints.
