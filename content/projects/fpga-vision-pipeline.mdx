## Overview
Developed a deterministic image processing pipeline that classifies parts on a conveyor in real time.

## Role
Implemented pre-processing stages in FPGA fabric and calibrated the ML inference handoff path.

## Problem
CPU-only inference couldn't satisfy 30fps with predictable latency under industrial loads.

## Constraints
- Tight power budget (&lt;8W).
- Deterministic latency requirement for actuator timing.
- Limited labeled data for minority defect classes.

## Approach
Offloaded resize + normalization + edge extraction to FPGA, keeping classifier execution compact.

## Architecture
Camera frames stream into DMA buffers, FPGA kernels preprocess tensors, ARM core runs ONNX model and emits class decisions.

## Results
- End-to-end median latency reduced from 96ms to 21ms.
- Throughput reached 33fps with jitter under 3ms.
- Defect recall improved by 18% after targeted augmentation.

## Impact
Enabled real-time reject decisions without replacing existing line controllers.

## Engineering Decisions
- Chose fixed-point arithmetic for kernels to control power and timing predictability.
- Added per-stage telemetry counters to pinpoint bottlenecks during bench testing.

## Lessons Learned
Operational observability should be designed into hardware-software pipelines from day one.

## Next Steps
Evaluate quantized transformer heads for better defect localization.
